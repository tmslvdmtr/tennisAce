# tennisAce
A simple project to exercise simple and multiple linear regression 

This is part of the CodeCademy Machine Learning/AI Engineer Career Path and it is meant to exercise the knowldege behind their simple and multiple linear regression lessons.

The project's goal is to predict the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits and what it takes to become a great player. I've provided 1 simple LR model, 1 using only 2 dependant values and 1 based on more than 10 dependant values. 

The libraries used here are:
- pandas;
- matplotlib;
- scikit-learn.
